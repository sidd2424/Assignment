    In the COVID-19 recovery period, physical stores are uniquely poised to offer 
    this crucial human interaction. A 2015 study led by Marshall Fisher, professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School of Business, clearly shows 
    the importance of human interaction in retail, and its impact on revenues.
    Yet in 2020, as retailers slowly reopen, they’re focusing on safety and 
    hygiene protocols but continuing to fail to invest in their own human capital.
    Instead of recognizing the long-term benefits of devoting attention to their
    employees, they obsess over minimizing labour costs, leading to increased
    employee turnover and poorly managed stores.With less traffic coming into 
    stores, expectations from those brave enough to venture out are significantly 
    higher, and retailers must invest in their teams if they want to stay relevant.    
    They could borrow from a Toronto bike store’s playbook that saw revenues 
    double during COVID-19, the owners recently told me. Open less than 18 months, 
    the Dismount Bike Shop team built a reputation for cutting-edge merchandise 
    selection, precise product and industry knowledge and outstanding customer 
    experience.When the crisis hit, the company’s seamless pivot to online 
    bookings with well-organized physical appointments helped achieve 100 per 
    cent conversion rates.Training is key Product and industry expertise are not 
    negotiable. Fisher’s study found that retailers who train their front-line 
    employees sell 125 per cent more than those that offer no training. 
    To overcome the current COVID-19 sanitation requirements and foster an 
    authentic human experience, retail workers must also demonstrate specific 
    interpersonal soft skills. To do so within a no-touch situation means 
    capitalizing on other senses to engage. From that initial eye contact and 
    open body language to a warm welcome, empathetic and friendly communication 
    is key. Companies that commit to training sales advisers to expertly sell 
    products while demonstrating high levels of relationship-building skills 
    won’t just attract and retain the best employees. They will also drive 
    in-store sales and customer retention. It’s time to stop considering employees as a cost and stores as showrooms. Instead, retailers should invest in their in-store teams and train them to become revenue generators. The human touch will define who the winners will be post-coronavirus.
